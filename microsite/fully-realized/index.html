    <h2 id="imagetext">What are Spaghetti Westerns?</h2>
    <img id="main" src="assets/images/frontpagestill.jpeg">
  <p>
    The spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in
    Europe. It emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of <b>Sergio Leone's</b> filmmaking
    style and international box-office success. The term was used by foreign
    critics because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by
    Italians.
  </p>

  <p>
    The majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were international
    co-productions by Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, West Germany,
    Britain, Portugal, Greece, Yugoslavia, and the United States. Over six
    hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978. Most spaghetti
    Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets, and shot at
    Cinecitt√† Studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leone's films and other core spaghetti Westerns are often described as
    having eschewed, criticized or even "demythologized" many of the conventions
    of traditional U.S. Westerns. This was partly intentional, and partly the
    context of a different cultural background. In 1968, the wave of spaghetti
    Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film
    production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. Spaghetti Westerns have
    left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works
    produced in and outside of Italy.
