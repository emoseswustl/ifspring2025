                <p>One, two, three</p>
                <p>Wait, is this the song with the drums?</p>

                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <p>I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring</p>
                <p>He argued with me about everything</p>
                <p>He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye</p>
                <p>He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"</p>
                <p>But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends</p>
                <p>And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end</p>
                <p>Another song, another club, another bar, another dance</p>
                <p>And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France</p>
                <p>So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed</p>
                <p>'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend</p>
                <p>Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down</p>
                <p>If I had to choose, I would say right now</p>

                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p>I wanna get him back</p>
                <p>I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad</p>
                <p>Oh, I wanna get him back</p>
                <p>'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad</p>
                <p>Oh, I want sweet revenge</p>
                <p>And I want him again</p>
                <p>I want to get him back, back, back</p>

            <div class="lyric_group">
                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                <p>So I write him all these letters and I throw them in the trash</p>
                <p>'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh</p>
                <p>Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "Send"</p>
                <p>I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends</p>
                <p>Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do</p>
                <p>He said I was the only girl but that just wasn't the truth</p>
                <p>And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'</p>
                <p>But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him</p>
